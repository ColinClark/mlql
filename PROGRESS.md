# MLQL Development Progress

## Current Branch: feature/complete-operators

### Completed Work

#### Phase 1: Expression Support ✅
- Column references
- Literals (int, float, string, bool, null)
- Binary operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
- Function calls

#### Phase 2: Basic Operators ✅
- Filter operator (WHERE clause)
- Sort operator (ORDER BY with ASC/DESC)
- Take operator (LIMIT)
- Select with wildcard (*)

#### Phase 3: Projection Operator ✅
**Key Achievement**: Fixed the "hard stuff" - binary operator parsing

**Problem**: Parser was losing operators in expressions like `age * 2`
- Only parsed as `age`, completely dropping `* 2`
- Root cause: Pest grammar had operators in non-capturing inline groups

**Solution**: Rewrote Pest grammar to extract operators as separate rules:
```pest
# Before (broken):
mul_expr = { unary_expr ~ (("*" | "/" | "%") ~ unary_expr)* }

# After (fixed):
mul_expr = { unary_expr ~ (mul_op ~ unary_expr)* }
mul_op = { "*" | "/" | "%" }
```

Applied same fix to all operators:
- `add_op`: `+`, `-`
- `mul_op`: `*`, `/`, `%`
- `or_op`: `||`
- `and_op`: `&&`
- `not_op`: `!`
- `cmp_op`: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `like`, `ilike`

**Tests Passing**:
- ✅ `from users | select [name, age]` → `SELECT name, age FROM users`
- ✅ `from users | select [age * 2 as double_age]` → `SELECT (age * 2) AS double_age FROM users`

#### Phase 4: Filter Combinations ✅
All comparison and logical operators working in WHERE clauses:

**Tests Passing**:
- ✅ `filter age > 25` → `WHERE (age > 25)`
- ✅ `filter age > 25 && age < 40` → `WHERE ((age > 25) AND (age < 40))`
- ✅ `filter name == "Alice" || name == "Bob"` → `WHERE ((name = 'Alice') OR (name = 'Bob'))`
- ✅ `filter name like "A%"` → `WHERE (name LIKE 'A%')`

### LLM JSON IR Format ✅

**Achievement**: Complete JSON IR schema for LLM output

**Why JSON IR?**
1. **Validation**: JSON schema validation before execution
2. **Repair**: Structured errors make fixing easier
3. **Caching**: Deterministic fingerprinting via SHA-256
4. **Provenance**: Track query origin and transformations
5. **Safety**: Type-checked before SQL generation

**Documentation**: `docs/llm-json-format.md` contains:
- Complete JSON schema with examples
- All operators and expressions
- Binary/unary operator reference tables
- LLM prompt templates

**JSON Format Example**:
```json
{
  "pipeline": {
    "source": {
      "type": "Table",
      "name": "users"
    },
    "ops": [
      {
        "op": "Filter",
        "condition": {
          "type": "BinaryOp",
          "op": "Gt",
          "left": {
            "type": "Column",
            "col": {"column": "age"}
          },
          "right": {
            "type": "Literal",
            "value": 25
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Tests Passing**:
- ✅ 3 JSON parsing tests in `mlql-ir`
- ✅ 2 end-to-end LLM JSON execution tests in `mlql-duck`
- ✅ Verified LLM JSON → IR → SQL → Results flow

### Architecture Simplification ✅

**Before**:
```
MLQL Text → AST → IR → Substrait Proto → DuckDB Extension
```

**After**:
```
MLQL Text → AST → IR → SQL → DuckDB
     OR
LLM JSON → IR → SQL → DuckDB
```

**Benefits**:
- Removed Substrait dependency (complex protobuf encoding)
- Removed DuckDB extension requirement
- Upgraded to DuckDB 1.4 with bundled build
- Cleaner SQL generation (no nested subqueries)

### SQL Generation Quality ✅

**Problem**: Generated nested subqueries:
```sql
SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM users)
```

**Solution**: Rewrote `build_sql_query()` to accumulate clauses:
```rust
let mut select_clause = "*";
let mut where_clause = None;
let mut order_clause = None;
let mut limit_clause = None;

// Process operators
for op in operators { ... }

// Build final SQL
format!("SELECT {} FROM {}", select_clause, table)
```

**Result**: Clean, single SELECT statements:
```sql
SELECT name, age FROM users WHERE (age > 25) ORDER BY age DESC LIMIT 10
```

#### Phase 5: Distinct Operator ✅
Implemented DISTINCT keyword support in SQL generation.

**Tests Passing**:
- ✅ `test_distinct_single_column` - SELECT DISTINCT city FROM users
- ✅ `test_distinct_multiple_columns` - SELECT DISTINCT city, state FROM locations

#### Phase 6: GroupBy Operator ✅
Implemented GROUP BY with aggregate functions (sum, count, avg).

**Implementation**:
- GROUP BY keys become first columns in SELECT
- Aggregate functions with user-defined aliases
- Supports count(*), sum(col), avg(col), min(col), max(col)

**Tests Passing**:
- ✅ `test_group_by_simple` - SELECT city, count(*) AS total FROM orders GROUP BY city
- ✅ `test_group_by_multiple_aggregates` - SELECT product, sum(qty) AS total_qty, avg(price) AS avg_price FROM sales GROUP BY product

**Note**: Uses JSON IR format (LLM-friendly). MLQL text parser support for GROUP BY syntax to be added later.

### Test Summary

#### Phase 7: Join Operator ✅
Implemented JOIN support with multiple join types.

**Implementation**:
- JOIN modifies FROM clause instead of WHERE
- Supports INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER, CROSS JOIN
- Multiple JOINs chain in FROM clause
- ON conditions converted via expr_to_sql()

**Tests Passing**:
- ✅ `test_join_inner` - SELECT * FROM users INNER JOIN orders ON condition
- ✅ `test_join_left` - SELECT * FROM users LEFT JOIN orders ON condition (includes NULL rows)
- ✅ `test_join_multiple` - 3-table chain: users → orders → products

### Codebase Cleanup ✅

**Removed Substrait**: Deleted 2,820 lines of unused Substrait code
- Removed mlql-substrait crate entirely
- Removed prost, prost-types, prost-reflect dependencies
- Renamed SubstraitError → SqlError
- Simplified architecture: direct SQL generation only

#### Phase 8: Union/Except/Intersect ⏸️
**Status**: Deferred pending architectural decision

**Reason**: Set operations (UNION/EXCEPT/INTERSECT) are binary operations that combine two complete SQL queries. The current pipeline architecture processes operators sequentially on a single source, which doesn't naturally support combining two pipelines.

**Future Options**:
1. Add `right_pipeline` field to set operation operators in IR
2. Implement at query combiner level (above single pipeline)
3. Support via CTEs (Common Table Expressions)

**Priority**: Low - all core SQL operators are complete and working

### Summary of Completed Phases

**Phases 1-7: Complete ✅**
- ✅ Expression Support (arithmetic, comparison, logical operators)
- ✅ Basic Operators (SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT)
- ✅ Projection with expressions and aliases
- ✅ Filter combinations (AND, OR, LIKE)
- ✅ DISTINCT keyword
- ✅ GROUP BY with aggregates (count, sum, avg, min, max)
- ✅ JOIN operations (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER, CROSS)

**Phase 8: Deferred ⏸️**
- UNION/EXCEPT/INTERSECT (requires architectural changes)

**Total Tests Passing**: 28

## Key Learnings

1. **Pest PEG Parsing**: Operators in repetition patterns (`*`) must be separate named rules to be captured
2. **Clean SQL Generation**: Accumulate clauses instead of nesting subqueries
3. **JSON IR for LLMs**: Structured output is easier to validate, repair, and cache than text
4. **TDD Approach**: Write tests first, implement features, commit when passing

## Development Workflow

1. Pick task from TODO.md
2. Write test case first (TDD)
3. Implement feature
4. Run tests until passing
5. Commit with descriptive message
6. Update TODO.md
7. Move to next task

## Project Health

- ✅ All core tests passing
- ✅ Clean git history with descriptive commits
- ✅ Architecture simplified and modernized
- ✅ Documentation complete for LLM integration
- ✅ Ready for Phase 5: Distinct operator
